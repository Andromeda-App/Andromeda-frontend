# Andromeda Stargazer


## A stargazer's best friend

Andromeda provides users real time updates and notification about space weather. Get alerts about auroras, meteor showers, ISS flyovers, and more! Stay tuned to the latest happenings in our Solar System!

## Technologies Used

Andromeda is built using React for the user interface, cloudinary for image uploading, and Amazon SNS for text messaging. Our CSS framwork is Tailwinds.

We sourced data from serveral APIs, notably:
 - ZipCode API to get location
 - MoonCalc API to get moonrise, moonset, phase, and eclipse notifications
 - NASA APOD API for daily astrophotography splash page
 - Where the ISS at? for real time location of the ISS
 - Donki for space weather observations and forecasts provided by the NOAA SWPC.
