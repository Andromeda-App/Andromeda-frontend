# Andromeda Space Weather Alert App

## A stargazer's best friend

Take your stargazing to the next level with Andromeda Space Weather Alert App! Get aurora forecast prediction maps, coronal mass ejection watch, or follow the International Space Station!

## Technologies Used

Andromeda is built using React for the user interface, Bootstrap for CSS, EmailJS for automated event emails, and ZipCode API for latitude and longitude estimation.

We sourced our data from NASA and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, using the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) API.

Our ISS tracker uses the Where the ISS at? API.

Our splash page uses the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day as a background.
